# Book Brackets

Is your to-be-read pile way too large? Can't figure out what you should be reading? Well now you can decide what to read by placing your books head-to-head in a March Madness style tournament! The project is still in it's early stages, but here's a list of what I'm thinking next!

1. A modern and lightweight UI using Javascript that I can maybe port between a website, a mobile app, and Electron
2. The ability to input your own TBR pile into the app.
3. Integration with your GoodReads account.
4. Bracket auto-fill using both metadata-based predictions and complete randomness.
